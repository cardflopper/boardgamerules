## Player Turn

Players do the following phases

1. Gear-up
2. Battle

## Phase Details

### 1. Gear Up

* Shuffle the current round equipment cards and deal 6 to each player
* Players draft cards
  * upgrade skills (gain gold equal to current round number)
  * buy equipment (can convert an owned equipment to skill before buying)

### 2. Battle

#### Main steps

1. Reveal: If there is no monster next to the Monster deck, draw one. This is called the **open monster**
2. Select:
    * Monster in front of player? Proceed with Attack or Pass monster then gain a new monster (draw from the deck or the open monster)
    * No Monster in front of player? gain a new monster (draw from the deck or the open monster).
    * If a player can't gain a new monster (from the deck or an open monster), then skip their battle.
3. Attack: Choose a weapon to battle with. No weapon = default 1 melee damage
4. Monster Attacks:
    * Player or monster defeated? go to step 5
    * Neither player or monster is defeated: Skip step 5, next player takes their battle turn.
5. Combat result:
    * If player is defeated, they lose a skill card and sit out for the rest of this Battle phase but still collect gold from other player battles
    * If monster is defeated
      * deal out gold 1 at a time, active player -> left -> right (repeat)
      * check if trophies are awarded
      * player will fight another monster next battle turn

#### End of Battle

* When the last monster is drawn, each player takes one more turn to attempt to defeat their monster but they skip Battle step 1 and 2. If the monster isn't defeated, it escapes and is returned to the box.

## Trophies

### Challenge trophy

* When a monster is defeated, check the corresponding challenge trophy for that monster type. There are 3 cases:

1. Trophy is unclaimed: The active player takes the trophy and 1 VP
2. Trophy is owned by another player: If the active player equals other player, the active player takes trophy and 1 VP
3. Active player already has the trophy: nothing happens.

### Collection trophy

* When a monster is defeated, if the set collection requirements are met, the player is awarded the topmost trophy from the stack.
* Players may only gain one trophy from each of the 6 stacks

## Charge

* The monster ability "Charge" trigger on a player in two cases.

1. The player draws a monster card with charge.
2. The player who holds a challenger trophy when a matching open monster is drawn.

* The charge ability doesn't trigger when monsters are dealt at beginning of Battle or when passed by a player

## Final Scoring

* score VP according to track
* score VP from trophies
* score for gold
  * Most = 6 VP
  * Second most = 3VP
